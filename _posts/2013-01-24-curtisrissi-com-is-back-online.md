I am happy to report that [CurtisRissi.com](http://www.curtisrissi.com) up and online! Its not much, but its at least a start and will continue to increase in functionality over time.  As mentioned in my post, "The Year of the Hustle", this is simply one item of step one, but is, by far, my most critical site and seeing tangible progress is invigorating.  The site is my first real attempt at implementing a Twitter Bootstrap theme and was a great learning experience.  If anyone reading this has suggestions, please list them in the comments; I'd love to hear them.
