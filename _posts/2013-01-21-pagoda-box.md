For the past few months I have been experimenting with the various Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers for PHP and the winner so far is hands down - [Pagoda Box](www.Pagodabox.com).  This amazing tool is still under active development, but is insanely cheap and offers some amazing functionality that its competitors don't.  Probably most compelling feature is its support for persistent files storage with - wait for it - SSH access. That's correct - not everything has to be stored in Git. If you haven't decided on a PHP PaaS solution, or even if you already have, I recommend checking them out.
